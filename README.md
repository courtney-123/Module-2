Throughout this lecturecast it helped me to understand what i was going to be learning about and what the machine learning module involved. 


During unit 1 i also had to have a disucssion about the 4th industrial revolution.

This was interesting to learn and research as a way to get into this module as it taught me alot about the data world and it was interesting to see other peoples opinions aswell.


# Unit 2:

unit 2 consisted of continuing the disucssion from unit 1 and also reading some articles to help me develop my knowledge for throughout the module. 


# unit 3: 

unit 3 Lecturecast on Correlation and Regression

This was interesting to learn because it was preparing me for the activity on Correlation and Regression at the end of unit 3 and also a similar activity in unit 7. it helped a lot but i still struggled to get an understanding of how to use it, i struggle alot with code. I think in my own time i need to spend some time researching and playing around with it to get a better understanding of how to use it so i can become confident in doing so. 


# Unit 4:

In unit 4 i continued with other work and also reading the set articles to gather more knowledge. this is an interesting task because it teaches me in a range of ways.


# Unit 5: 

Lecturecast on Clustering.

Unit 5 also consisted of a task to complete on Jaccard Coefficient Calculations. This was a fun task to complete, it took me a while to understand how to complete this task but once i did it was interesting to complete and fun.

# Unit 6:

For this Assignment i was assigned a small team, we had to work together to complete this project and create an anylitical report involving the Airbnb buinsness. We came up with the question of what key factors influence the price of Airbnb listings in New York city.

This task had its challenges of working as a team because of time zone differences, it was hard to set up meetings to discuss the work with a time that was suitable for everyone, language barrier was a difficulty but we managed to overcome it and complete our tasks. The one thing i struggled with involing the work was that when we set tasks it was a struggle then reading the whole report becausee i didnt understand how they came to that conclusion because it was a section of the report i didnt figure out how to complete so i didnt understand the end result.

This is the feedback from the tutor from this assignment.


# Unit 7:


Lecturecast on Artificial Neural Network.

Throughout this Lecturecast i learned about the ANN, this was interesting to learn and work through and will later throughout the module become very useful.

# unit 8:

unit 8 Lecturecast continued on from unit 7 and taught me about the backpropagation in ANN's. 


<img width="741" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-06 at 23 23 09" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2df99e3d-c6ba-4fbd-9024-fdd4e833676f" />

Unit 8 consisted of another discussion, this one was about legal and ethical views on ANN applications. This was interesting to read and research about and taught me alot, learning different areas of ANN's definietly helped me learn about it in all different areas.

In this unit i had to complete a task on gradient cost function, i changed iteration numbers and learning_rate to observe how cost decreased. It was intersting to see how these numbers changing effected the cost and how it changed. This took me a while to understand and i did struggle and i think if i was to do it again after not doing it for a while i would forget how to do it. I definietly need more practice and to work on it more. 


# Unit 9:

Lecturecast on Convolutional Neural Networks CNN's.
This was interesting to learn about a different type of Neural Network and what it consisted of. 


<img width="739" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 23 10 30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c945e5d6-7c7c-4683-9ec2-eb83f7710d9c" />

During this unit i also had to complete a report on the ethical and social implications on convolutional neural networks. This was abit hard to find the information as i needed it but it was interesting to learn the implications of data models and that its not all good, there are many considerations that need to be thought about before bringing such a network into the real world.

# Unit 10:

This unit consisted of continuing other work and reading and researching ready for my next assignment coming up in the next Unit. 


# Unit 11:

Lecturecast on Model Selection and Evaluation. 
This was fun to read through and learn about and it helped me develop my knowledge.

This unit also consisted of an assignment, creating a presentation on Neural Networks. This took me a while to understand the data side of it, but the background information was easy to understand as i had done reading and tasks on it throughout this module. I am not good at talking about presentations so this was abit difficult to get out of my comfort zone but i believe the more i do this the more comfortable i will become.

My last work for this unit was creating a reflection of everything i did throughout this module. This was useful to look back on everything and actually think about my feelings while completing these taks and how and what i struggled with, this will help me developed and become better at the work.
